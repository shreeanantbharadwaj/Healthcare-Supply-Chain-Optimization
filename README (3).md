# Supply Chain Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing a detailed analysis of supply chain data, aimed at identifying inefficiencies and optimizing various aspects such as inventory levels and demand forecasting. By utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, the project seeks to improve the overall supply chain management process and provide actionable insights for businesses.

## Dataset

The dataset contains operational data related to supply chain processes, including features such as:
- Product demand
- Inventory levels
- Transportation data
- Lead times
- Supplier and customer information

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
2. Develop predictive models to forecast product demand and optimize inventory management.
3. Leverage machine learning techniques like CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) for demand forecasting and supply chain optimization.

## Key Features

- **Demand Forecasting**: Predict future product demand based on historical data and trends.
- **Inventory Optimization**: Suggest optimal inventory levels to reduce waste and improve efficiency.
- **Advanced Machine Learning Models**: Use a variety of models including gradient boosting techniques (CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM) and RNN to capture time-based dependencies in supply chain data.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compare model performance using metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and RÂ².
